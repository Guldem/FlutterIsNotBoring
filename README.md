# flutter_is_not_boring  
  
Flutter based app to help find an activity when bored  
  
It can randomly find an activity for you or you can specify some preferences to find better suited activities.  

## Dependencies
- Lottie for flutter: [github](https://github.com/xvrh/lottie-flutter)

## Thinks learned  
First time creating something more then a few buttons and a counter. I learned how to:
- Create custom widgets
- Navigate between screens
- Do some state management

## Wishlist feature
- Proper project structure?  
-  Save favorite activities
-  Localisation
- a11y support (talkback)

## Notes  
Its only tested on a android emulator. Maybe lottie components will crash on iOS.
